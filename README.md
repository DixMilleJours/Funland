# HEY THERE!

### This is the award-winning VR game developed with Unity3D during the China National Hackathon!

##### Game Setting: 
- The whole immersive setting is located on a charming beach, with a floating island above you!
- I'm really being creative to conjure such a setting for equally creative and explorative you!

##### Time to play around:
- You are spawned in a well-decorated room floating in the air. You could see the great sceneries through the window!

- Please look around in this room!

- 'Jump' out of the window and land on the warm and soft sand!

- Step onto the elegant ship and watch the fishes swimming freely!

- Prove that you are a good shooter -- try the sniper rifle and hit the target!

- Most realistic VR experience -- Feel the excitement and hone your skills through trying to climb the vines all the way to the top and see the grand fountain

- Or... simply wandering around and enjoy the sceneries!

##### How to realize this dreamy world:
- Precision in codes:  
  - Clear understanding of delivery time and early testing.
  - Based on defect clustering, effectively test the modules.
- Clear division of labor:
  - Optimizing resources / C# scripting / Product introduction prep / Troubleshooting -- No one does them all!
- I learn Unity3D's underlying knowledge(rigid body, terrain, ray casting...) & learn how to write functional C# scripts.
- Solid sense of teamwork:
  - We value regular technical discussions and exchanging ideas for potential improvement in user experience.
  - Always ready to support my teammates when facing challenges. Always illustrate ideas in an understandable way!
  
##### Statements:
- During a week's development process, we truly wrote some amazing codes that enabled lots of actions besides the original codes for some of Unity's default actions. For example, we realized the sniper rifle's action of zooming and shooting, realistic grabbing to the vines, events of fishes swimming around the ship, and so on. However, due to poor performance of our labtops, we could only develop the whole game on provided desktop computer. Therefore, I genuinely want to include thoses codes but could only show the images and a short video to demonstrate the game.
