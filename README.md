# HEY THERE!

### This is the award-winning VR game developed with Unity3D during the China National Hackathon!

##### Game Setting: 
- The whole immersive setting is located on a charming beach, with a floating island above you!
- I'm really beening creative to conjure such a setting for equally creative and explorative you!

##### Time to play around:
- You are spawned in [a well-decorated room](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lowdrag-zty/lowdrag-zty.github.io/master/Sceneries/spawn_point.png) floating in the air. 
- 'Jump' out of the window and land on the warm and soft sand!

- Step onto [the elegant ship](https://github.com/lowdrag-zty/lowdrag-zty.github.io/blob/master/Sceneries/beautiful_ship.png) and watch the fishes swimming freely!

- Prove that you are a good shooter -- [try the sniper rifle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lowdrag-zty/lowdrag-zty.github.io/master/Sceneries/shooting_challenge.png) and hit the target!

- Most realistic VR experience -- climb the vines to finally reach the top and [see the shrine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lowdrag-zty/lowdrag-zty.github.io/master/Sceneries/vines_climbing.png)!

- Or... simply wandering around and enjoy the sceneries!

##### How to realize this dreamy world:
- Precision in codes:  
  - Clear understanding of delivery time and early testing.
  - Based on defect clustering, effectively test the modules.
- Clear division of labor:
  - Optimize resources / C# scripting / Product introduction prep / Troubleshooting -- No one does them all!
